USER INSTRUCTIONS:
In Eclipse, link the 'library' folder into a new project.  Make sure 
that it compiles. Then, create your own Java project, and configure its 
build path to require this project.

In BlueJ, open the library as a project, and rebuild every package 
bottom up, to ensure that the .class files are all in sync with the 
.java files.  Then add the 'library' folder to your user libraries.
